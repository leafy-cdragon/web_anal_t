# Web Analysis Tool - README

## Overview

The Web Analysis Tool is a comprehensive Python-based application designed for educational purposes to help users understand website structures, data collection methodologies, and authentication systems. It combines data collection capabilities from visited websites, backend structure analysis, and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) key generation and management functionalities. This tool is intended to provide a practical learning platform for web technologies and security principles, emphasizing ethical use and responsible operation.

## Purpose

This tool was developed to offer insights into how websites are built and how data can be programmatically collected and analyzed. It also introduces users to the concepts of PGP encryption for secure communication and its potential role in authentication mechanisms. The primary goal is to enhance understanding of web technologies in a controlled and ethical manner.

**Ethical Use Mandate:** This tool must ONLY be used on websites where you have explicit, verifiable permission to conduct analysis and data collection. All testing, especially features related to authentication, must be performed in controlled environments such as local development servers, personal websites, or dedicated testing platforms where the user is the owner or has explicit authorization. Unauthorized access attempts against any system are illegal and unethical. The tool includes warnings and is designed to discourage misuse; users are expected to adhere strictly to these guidelines and all applicable laws and terms of service.

## Features

The Web Analysis Tool is composed of several key modules:

1.  **Data Collection Component:**
    *   Scrapes and collects data from specified websites.
    *   Stores collected data in structured formats (CSV, JSON).
    *   Allows for basic filtering and searching (conceptual, to be expanded in GUI).
    *   Extracts website metadata (titles, descriptions, keywords).
    *   Logs HTTP request/response headers and server responses for analysis.

2.  **Backend Analysis and Visualization Module:**
    *   Visualizes website structure and hierarchy (textual/dictionary-based map).
    *   Identifies backend technologies and frameworks (e.g., CMS, JavaScript libraries, web servers).
    *   Attempts to discover publicly accessible API endpoints and their parameters.
    *   Provides a basic analysis of observed authentication mechanisms (e.g., login forms, cookie types).
    *   Conceptually allows for mapping database structures if accessible through non-intrusive public information (with strong ethical caveats).

3.  **PGP Key Generation and Management Component:**
    *   Facilitates the creation of secure PGP key pairs (public/private).
    *   Includes a key management system for listing, exporting, importing, and deleting keys (interfacing with GnuPG).
    *   Enables the use of generated keys for encrypting and decrypting messages/files.
    *   Provides a **simulation** feature for understanding how PGP keys *could* be used in authentication, strictly for educational purposes on user-owned systems.

4.  **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
    *   Offers a user-friendly interface built with PyQt6 for accessing all tool functionalities.
    *   Includes clear sections for each component and displays results and logs.
    *   Integrates ethical warnings and reminders for responsible use.

5.  **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   Implements robust error handling to manage unexpected situations gracefully.
    *   Provides comprehensive logging of tool activities, errors, and user actions to a file for diagnostics and auditing.

## Technology Stack

*   **Core Language:** Python 3
*   **GUI:** PyQt6
*   **Web Interaction:** `requests` library
*   **HTML/XML Parsing:** `BeautifulSoup4` (with `lxml`)
*   **Technology Identification:** `builtwith` library
*   **PGP Operations:** `python-gnupg` (as a wrapper for GnuPG)
*   **Data Formatting:** `csv`, `json` (built-in Python modules)
*   **Logging:** `logging` (built-in Python module)

## Project Structure

The tool is organized into the following main directories:

*   `/docs`: Contains all documentation files (like this one).
*   `/src`: Contains the source code for the application.
